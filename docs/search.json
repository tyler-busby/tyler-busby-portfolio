    "text": "Data Description\nThe data I will be using was gathered from user observations on iNaturalist, using the following website: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export.\nThe data focuses on nudibranch observations in Monterey Bay Marine Sanctuary from January 1st to December 31st, 2024. It covers all user-submitted observations of animals in the order Nudibranchia that are considered “research grade”, meaning the nudibranch ID was confirmed by at least one other user. The data also only includes observations marked as open, meaning they have an associated location.\nThe dataset includes a number of variables, including observation id variables: id, uuid, user_id, user_name, and url. Time and date variables for the observation, including observed_on, time_observed_at, and time_zone. There are also location variables: place_guess, latitude, longitude, and positional_accuracy. The main variables I will focus on have to do with the observation’s taxonomy including it’s common_name, scientific_name, taxon_genus_name, taxon_family_name, and more for every taxon delineation from suborder to form. The number of agreements and disagreements along with other information included by the observer, such as tag_list and description.\nMost of the data is character data, with the exception of observed_on, which is a date, and number_identification_agreements, number_identification_disagreements, latitude, longitude, and positional_accuracy, which are numerical variables.\nThe main questions I hope to answer with my data are:\n- What were the most commonly-observed nudibranch species in Monterey Bay in 2024?\n- How biodiverse were nudibranch populations in Monterey Bay in 2024?\n- How do nudibranch populations change in Monterey Bay over time?\n\n\nData Cleaning\nThere is also some missing data in the common_name variable coded as blanks, as some species of nudibranchs do not have a common name in iNaturalist.\nBased on my goal, I will not need to filter my data nor join my data with any preexisting datasets.\nFor my first visualization, I will have to create a new variable in order to include images in my bar graph.\nThere are a few variables I will want to exclude from my dataset including the observation id variables and many of the taxon designation variables that are entirely NAs, such as taxon_tribe_name and taxon_hybrid_name.\nI will not need to pivot my data.\nAs stated in the Data Visualization section, I will have to summarize my data into total number of observations for each species in order to create some of my visualizations.\nOne other aspect I am going to want to fix has to do with the common_name variable, as I want to refer to most species of nudibranch by their common name; however, a few species of nudibranch do not have a common name. Thus, I want to find a way to set their common name to be the same as their scientific name or create an entirely new name variable that can use their scientific name in place of the common name.\nThe code to add an image file on lines 76-77 were modeled using a tutorial from Dean Chereden on YouTube.
